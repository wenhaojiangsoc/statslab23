Lab materials for SOC-GA 2332 Intro to Stats (Fall 2023, NYU Sociology) \
Office Hours: Tuesday 11-12:20PM [here if meet on Zoom](https://nyu.zoom.us/my/wenhaojiang)
 

### Prerequisite
+ Please download & install R: https://cloud.r-project.org/

+ Please sign up for Overleaf (for LaTeX): https://www.overleaf.com/. Using your `nyu` email address will give you free access to professional account. We will use Overleaf for the final replication project.
+ For Mac users, please download and install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/). For Windows users, please download and install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). We will need a TeX installation to knit R Markdown codes into PDFs to complete assignments.
+ We can trouble shoot in Lab, but you can also email me if you have questions or run into issues: wj2068@nyu.edu

+ Download the lab or assignment folder from the link: https://download-directory.github.io/. You will need to **copy and paste the link of the folder after you click the target folder**. For example, lab 1 link is: https://github.com/wenhaojiangsoc/statslab/tree/main/lab1

### Problem Set 1 (Due 9/29/2023)
+ Please knit `ps1_problems.Rmd` in the `ps1` folder to convert the problem set to either a PDF or html file. Please submit a PDF file if you can, and only submit a html file if PDF is not possible. Please pay attention to the instructions of the assignment.

### Lab 2 Visualization and Sampling Simulation (9/15/2023)
+ Lab 2 covers basic visualizations in R using the standard package `ggplot2`. We will use the package to simulate the sampling process and visualize some properties for the sampling distribution. A guidance to assignment 1 will be included.

+ When you fail to knit your Rmarkdown file because of the `kableExtra` package, please run the following codes in your RStudio **Console**:
    + `install.packages("devtools")`
    + `devtools::install_github("kupietz/kableExtra")` \
Then knit the file again.

### Problem Set 2 (Due 10/23/2023)
+ Please knit `ps2_problems.Rmd` in the `ps2` folder to convert the problem set to either a PDF or html file.
+ Please feel free to raise questions in lab or in my office hours.
